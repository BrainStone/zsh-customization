# zsh-customization

These are my zsh settings and customizations. Will probably spend waaaaay too much time on that, but oh well...

## Installing

Installing this is super straight forward!

Just run the install.sh: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrainStone/zsh-customization/master/install.sh)"`
